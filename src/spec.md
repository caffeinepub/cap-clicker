# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a final footer credit line in the Cap Clicker main game view that says “Made by Anuj”.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the main game view footer content to append the text “Made by Anuj” as the last credit line (after existing copyright and caffeine.ai link).
- Ensure the new line uses existing footer styling (or a subtle compatible style) and remains responsive on mobile and desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Cap Clicker main screen, users see “Made by Anuj” as the final line in the footer credits.
